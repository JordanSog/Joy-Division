# Joy-Division
First program using GUI

This is my first program, I wanted to play around with printing lines on a canvas and this is what came of it.

The Program prints out the album cover for Joy Division's debut album 'Unknown Pleasures'. The image on the cover is a “stacked plot” of the radio emissions given out by a pulsar, a “rotating neutron star".

Any constructive criticism on my code is greatly appreciated.
